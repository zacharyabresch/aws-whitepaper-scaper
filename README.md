# AWS Whitepaper Scraper

I wanted to download all the AWS whitepapers for an upcoming RV road trip. I did _not_ want to click and download every one.

So, I made this.

## Usage

- Clone this repo
- `npm i`
- `node src/index.js`
- Marvel at _all_ the PDFs (**hint**: look in the `pdfs/` directory)!

If you run into trouble, make sure there is a `pdfs/` directory in the repo's root. If that doesn't fix it, submit an issue and we'll sort it out. :+1:
